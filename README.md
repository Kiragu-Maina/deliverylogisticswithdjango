# deliverylogisticswithdjango
A system to keep track of deliveries made by salespersons. 
Salespersons have an app(see my other repo on details about the app) where they select of a list of their shops on delivery completion or failure of.

This django code provides the backend that handles login, provides endpoints with assigned route and shop data. And also queries for their location to track the user.

See apis/views.py for available endpoints
